# Problem 1

## Derivation of Kepler's Third Law

### Step 1: Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

Newton's Law of Gravitation:

$$
F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

Centripetal force for circular motion:  

$$
F_c = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Equating $$F_g = F_c$$ :

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Canceling $$m$$ :

$$
\frac{G M}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Multiplying by $$r$$ :

$$
v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$


### Step 2: Expressing in Terms of Orbital Period  

Using  $$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$ :

$$\left( \frac{2\pi r}{T} \right)^2 = \frac{G M}{r}$$

$$\frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{G M}{r}$$

Multiplying by $$r$$ : 

$$
4\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2
$$

### Step 3: Final Relation  

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

Thus,

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

## Implications of Kepler’s Third Law in Astronomy  

Kepler’s Third Law $$T^2 \propto r^3$$ plays a key role in understanding celestial mechanics.

### 1. Calculating Planetary Masses  
Using $$M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}$$ we can determine the mass of a central body (e.g., the Sun, exoplanet host stars, or giant planets) by observing orbiting objects.

### 2. Measuring Distances  
If an object's orbital period is known, its distance can be calculated. This was historically used to estimate Solar System dimensions.  

### 3. Exoplanet Detection  
Kepler’s Law aids in finding exoplanets via transit and radial velocity methods, helping estimate their orbits and masses.

### 4. Orbital Stability & Dark Matter  
- Systems following $$T^2 \propto r^3$$ are gravitationally stable.  
- Deviations suggest additional planets or unseen mass (e.g., dark matter in galaxies).

### Conclusion  
Kepler’s Third Law is a fundamental tool in astronomy, linking planetary motion to gravitational interactions across the universe.
