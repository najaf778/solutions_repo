## Cosmic Velocities: First, Second, and Third

The concept of escape velocity is crucial for understanding the conditions required to leave a celestial body's gravitational influence. Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions.

## 1. First Cosmic Velocity — *Orbital Velocity*

### **Definition**:
The **first cosmic velocity** is the **minimum speed** that an object must have to **enter a stable circular orbit around a celestial body**, such as Earth, **without additional propulsion**.

### **Physical Meaning**:
- Launching an object horizontally at this speed causes it to "fall around" the planet.
- The object remains in continuous free-fall, creating an orbit.
- It is independent of the object’s mass (ignoring air resistance).

### **On Earth**:
- **Value**: ~**7.9 km/s** (≈ 28,400 km/h)
- **Altitude**: Close to Earth's surface (Low Earth Orbit)
- **Applications**: ISS, GPS satellites, other orbital spacecraft

## 2. Second Cosmic Velocity — *Escape Velocity*

### **Definition**:
The **second cosmic velocity** is the **minimum speed** required to **escape the gravitational field of a celestial body** without further propulsion.

### **Physical Meaning**:
- The object’s kinetic energy matches the gravitational potential energy.
- It escapes the planet’s pull and continues moving away indefinitely (ignoring other forces).

### **On Earth**:
- **Value**: ~**11.2 km/s** (≈ 40,320 km/h)
- **Applications**: Lunar missions, Mars missions, interplanetary probes

## 3. Third Cosmic Velocity — *Heliocentric Escape Velocity*

### **Definition**:
The **third cosmic velocity** is the **minimum speed** needed to **escape the Sun’s gravity** starting from Earth's orbit.

### **Physical Meaning**:
- A spacecraft already in solar orbit (after escaping Earth) needs this speed to **leave the Solar System**.
- It’s calculated relative to the Sun.

### **From Earth’s Orbit**:
- **Value**: ~**16.7 km/s** (≈ 60,120 km/h)
- **Applications**: Voyager 1 & 2, Pioneer, New Horizons missions
