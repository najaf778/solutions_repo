## Theoretical Foundation of Projectile Motion

### **Step 1: Deriving the Governing Equations**
Projectile motion is governed by Newtonâ€™s Second Law:

$$
\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
$$

For a projectile in freefall (neglecting air resistance), the only force acting on it is gravity, acting downward:

$$
F_y = -mg, \quad F_x = 0
$$

This results in the following equations of motion:

$$
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0
$$

$$
m \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg
$$
