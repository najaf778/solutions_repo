# Projectile Motion Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes the horizontal range of a projectile as a function of the angle of projection. Using fundamental physics equations, the script computes and visualizes the range for various angles, highlighting the optimal angle for maximum range.

## Governing Equations
The horizontal range \( R \) of a projectile is defined as:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$
