Horizontal Motion \\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{0x}\\) (constant) Second integration \u27f6 \\(x = v_{0x} t + x_0\\) Since \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] 2. Vertical Motion \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -gt + v_{0y}\\) Second integration \u27f6 \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_{0y} t + y_0\\) Since \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t + y_0 \\] Step 2: Family of Solutions Due to Initial Conditions The key initial conditions influencing projectile motion are: - Initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : A higher velocity results in a longer range and greater height. - Angle of launch ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : The range depends on \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) , peaking at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . - Initial height ( \\(y_0\\) ) : A nonzero height alters flight time and can extend range. By varying these parameters, we obtain different trajectories, illustrating how a simple equation generates a rich set of solutions. Practical Applications of Projectile Motion 1. Uneven Terrain When the projectile is launched on uneven terrain (with different launch and landing heights), the vertical motion equation becomes: \\[y = y_0 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\] To find the range, we solve for the time when \\(y = 0\\) , which may require solving a quadratic equation. 2. Air Resistance Air resistance modifies the trajectory, causing the projectile to deviate from the ideal parabolic path. The drag force is given by: \\[\\vec{F}_d = - \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\hat{v}\\] This force alters the equations of motion, resulting in non-linear differential equations that require numerical methods to solve. 3. Launch Angle and Velocity Adaptations Real-world factors like wind and non-uniform gravity affect launch angles and velocities. For example, wind can alter both the horizontal and vertical motion of the projectile. 4. Example Applications Sports : In soccer or basketball, air resistance affects ball trajectories. Ballistics : Air resistance and gravity are crucial for calculating missile trajectories. Space Exploration : Rockets need to account for changing gravity and air resistance. Engineering : Calculating trajectories for demolition charges requires adjustments for terrain and air resistance. 5. Numerical Solutions For complex scenarios (e.g., air resistance), numerical methods like Euler\u2019s method or Runge-Kutta are used to approximate the motion. Plot showing how the range varies with the angle of projection. As expected, the range is maximized at 45\u00b0, and it symmetrically decreases for angles above and below this value Effect of Initial Velocity on Range: Higher initial velocity significantly increases the range, following a quadratic relationship Effect of Gravity on Range: Weaker gravity (e.g., on the Moon) allows for much longer travel distances, while stronger gravity (e.g., on Jupiter) greatly reduces the range. Conslusion The study of projectile motion, particularly its range and dependence on parameters like launch angle, velocity, and gravity, provides essential insights into a variety of real-world phenomena.

Differential Equation Governing the Motion The motion of the forced damped pendulum is governed by the following second-order nonlinear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\( \\(\\theta(t)\\) \\) : Angular displacement of the pendulum at time \\( \\(t\\) \\) (in radians). - \\( \\(\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\\) \\) : Angular acceleration. - \\( \\(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\) \\) : Angular velocity. - \\( \\(b\\) \\) : Damping coefficient (describing resistive forces like air drag or friction). - \\( \\(\\frac{g}{L}\\) \\) : Restoring force per unit angular displacement ( \\( \\(g\\) \\) is gravitational acceleration and \\( \\(L\\) \\) is pendulum length). - \\( \\(A\\cos(\\omega t)\\) \\) : External periodic driving force with amplitude \\( \\(A\\) \\) and angular frequency \\( \\(\\omega\\) \\) . This equation captures the combined effects of: 1. The restoring torque \\( \\(-\\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta\\) \\) . 2. Damping torque \\( \\(-b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\) \\) . 3. Driving torque \\( \\(A\\cos(\\omega t)\\) \\) . 2. Approximate Solutions for Small-Angle Oscillations For small angular displacements ( \\( \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) \\) ), we can use the small-angle approximation: \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] Substituting this approximation into the governing equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is now a linear differential equation that can be solved analytically. Solution of the Linearized Equation The solution consists of two parts: 1. Transient Solution : Depends on initial conditions and decays due to damping ( \\( \\(b\\) \\) ). 2. Steady-State Solution : A sinusoidal solution synchronized with the driving force. Let the steady-state solution be: \\[ \\theta(t) = \\Theta \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) \\] where: - \\( \\(\\Theta\\) \\) : Amplitude of oscillation. - \\( \\(\\phi\\) \\) : Phase difference between the driving force and pendulum motion. Substitute this into the linearized equation: \\[ -\\omega^2\\Theta\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) + b\\omega\\Theta\\sin(\\omega t - \\phi) + \\frac{g}{L}\\Theta\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] Using trigonometric identities and matching coefficients, the amplitude \\( \\(\\Theta\\) \\) is: \\[ \\Theta = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{g}{L} - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + (b\\omega)^2}} \\] and the phase difference \\( \\(\\phi\\) \\) is: \\[ \\tan\\phi = \\frac{b\\omega}{\\frac{g}{L} - \\omega^2} \\] Interpretation \\( \\(\\Theta\\) \\) : Depends on the driving frequency \\( \\(\\omega\\) \\) , damping \\( \\(b\\) \\) , and natural frequency \\( \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) \\) . \\( \\(\\phi\\) \\) : Indicates how the motion lags behind the driving force. 3. Resonance Conditions and Energy Implications Resonance Condition Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \\( \\(\\omega\\) \\) matches the natural frequency \\( \\(\\omega_0\\) \\) : \\[ \\omega = \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] At resonance, the denominator of the amplitude equation is minimized: \\[ \\Theta_{\\text{resonance}} = \\frac{A}{b\\omega_0} \\] This results in a maximum amplitude of oscillation, limited only by damping ( \\( \\(b\\) \\) ). Implications for System's Energy Energy Transfer : At resonance, the driving force is perfectly in phase with the pendulum's motion, allowing maximum energy transfer. Large Amplitudes : Without damping ( \\( \\(b = 0\\) \\) ), the amplitude \\( \\(\\Theta\\) \\) would grow indefinitely at resonance, causing instability. However, damping dissipates energy and limits amplitude. Practical Systems : Mechanical Systems : Resonance can lead to catastrophic failures (e.g., bridge oscillations).

Energy Harvesting : Resonance can be exploited for efficient energy transfer in devices like pendulum-based generators. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp # Parameters g = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration (m/s^2) L = 1.0 # length of the pendulum (m) b = 0.5 # damping coefficient A = 1.5 # driving force amplitude omega = 2.0 # driving force frequency # Differential equation def forced_damped_pendulum(t, y): theta, omega_dot = y dtheta_dt = omega_dot domega_dt = -(b * omega_dot + (g / L) * np.sin(theta)) + A * np.cos(omega * t) return [dtheta_dt, domega_dt] # Time span and initial conditions t_span = (0, 50) # simulate from t=0 to t=50 seconds t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 10000) # time points for evaluation y0 = [0.1, 0] # initial angle (radians) and angular velocity (rad/s) # Solve the differential equation solution = solve_ivp(forced_damped_pendulum, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, method=\"RK45\") # Extract results t = solution.t theta = solution.y[0] omega_dot = solution.y[1] # Plotting results plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8)) # Time series plot plt.subplot(3, 1, 1) plt.plot(t, theta, label=\"Theta (angle)\") plt.plot(t, omega_dot, label=\"Angular velocity\") plt.title(\"Time Series of the Forced Damped Pendulum\") plt.xlabel(\"Time (s)\") plt.ylabel(\"Amplitude\") plt.legend() plt.grid() # Phase portrait plt.subplot(3, 1, 2) plt.plot(theta, omega_dot, label=\"Phase Portrait\") plt.title(\"Phase Portrait\") plt.xlabel(\"Theta (angle)\") plt.ylabel(\"Angular velocity\") plt.legend() plt.grid() # Poincar\u00e9 section def poincare_section(theta, omega_dot, time, period): poincare_theta = [] poincare_omega = [] for i in range(1, len(time) - 1): if abs(time[i] % period - 0) < (time[1] - time[0]): poincare_theta.append(theta[i]) poincare_omega.append(omega_dot[i]) return poincare_theta, poincare_omega # Compute Poincar\u00e9 section T = 2 * np.pi / omega # period of the driving force poincare_theta, poincare_omega = poincare_section(theta, omega_dot, t, T) plt.subplot(3, 1, 3) plt.scatter(poincare_theta, poincare_omega, s=10, label=\"Poincar\u00e9 Section\", color=\"red\") plt.title(\"Poincar\u00e9 Section\") plt.xlabel(\"Theta (angle)\") plt.ylabel(\"Angular velocity\") plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() # Bifurcation diagram (basic setup) def bifurcation_diagram(param_values, initial_conditions, t_span, t_eval): bifurcation_data = [] for param in param_values: global A A = param # vary the driving force amplitude solution = solve_ivp(forced_damped_pendulum, t_span, initial_conditions, t_eval=t_eval, method=\"RK45\") theta = solution.y[0] time = solution.t # Sample theta at driving force periods sampled_theta = [theta[i] for i in range(len(time)) if abs(time[i] % T - 0) < (time[1] - time[0])] bifurcation_data.append((param, sampled_theta)) return bifurcation_data # Parameters for bifurcation diagram param_values = np.linspace(0.5, 2.0, 50) # range of A values t_eval = np.linspace(0, 200, 20000) # longer simulation time bifurcation_data = bifurcation_diagram(param_values, y0, (0, 200), t_eval) # Plot bifurcation diagram plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for param, sampled_theta in bifurcation_data: plt.scatter([param] * len(sampled_theta), sampled_theta, s=1, color=\"blue\") plt.title(\"Bifurcation Diagram\") plt.xlabel(\"Driving Force Amplitude (A)\") plt.ylabel(\"Theta (angle)\") plt.grid() plt.show() https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z3rXVn59Yw0YD7s-eDadJzGF4U9LV8H7?usp=sharing","title":"Implications for System's Energy"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Derivation of Kepler's Third Law Step 1: Gravitational and Centripetal Forces Newton's Law of Gravitation: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] Centripetal force for circular motion: \\[ F_c = m \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Equating \\(F_g = F_c\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Canceling \\(m\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiplying by \\(r\\) : \\[ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Step 2: Expressing in Terms of Orbital Period Using \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) : \\[\\left( \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] \\[\\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] Multiplying by \\(r\\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2 \\] Step 3: Final Relation \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] Thus, \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] Implications of Kepler\u2019s Third Law in Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) plays a key role in understanding celestial mechanics. 1. Calculating Planetary Masses Using \\(M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}\\) we can determine the mass of a central body (e.g., the Sun, exoplanet host stars, or giant planets) by observing orbiting objects. 2. Measuring Distances If an object's orbital period is known, its distance can be calculated. This was historically used to estimate Solar System dimensions. 3. Exoplanet Detection Kepler\u2019s Law aids in finding exoplanets via transit and radial velocity methods, helping estimate their orbits and masses. 4. Orbital Stability & Dark Matter Systems following \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) are gravitationally stable. Deviations suggest additional planets or unseen mass (e.g., dark matter in galaxies). Conclusion Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a fundamental tool in astronomy, linking planetary motion to gravitational interactions across the universe. Real-World Examples of Kepler\u2019s Third Law 1. The Moon's Orbit Around Earth Orbital Period: Approximately 27.3 days. Average Distance: Roughly 384,400 km. Application: Using the formula \\(M_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2},\\) astronomers can calculate Earth's mass. Measurements from the Moon\u2019s motion yield a value consistent with independent estimates, demonstrating the law's accuracy in our own celestial backyard. 2. Planetary Orbits in the Solar System General Relationship: Every planet's orbital period \\(T\\) and average distance \\(r\\) from the Sun obey \\(T^2 \\propto r^3.\\) Example: Earth and Mars Earth: 1 year period at 1 astronomical unit (AU). Mars: Approximately 1.88 years period at about 1.52 AU. Implication: These proportionalities allow astronomers to derive the mass of the Sun and to predict planetary positions accurately. Conclusion Observations from the Moon's orbit to the trajectories of planets validate Kepler\u2019s Third Law, proving it essential for determining celestial masses and distances, and enhancing our understanding of gravitational dynamics in the Solar System. Kepler's Third Law and Elliptical Orbits Kepler\u2019s Third Law also applies to elliptical orbits, with the square of the orbital period \\(T\\) still being proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \\(a\\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] For elliptical orbits, the semi-major axis (the average distance between the orbiting body and the central body) governs the orbital period. 1. Application to Celestial Bodies Moons and Planets: The law applies to moons orbiting planets, such as Earth\u2019s Moon, and to exoplanets orbiting stars. Binary Star Systems: For binary stars, the combined mass and semi-major axis determine the orbital period. Complex Systems: In multi-body systems, Kepler\u2019s Law can still be used, but gravitational interactions and perturbations need to be considered. 2. Relativity and Modifications For systems with high masses or velocities, such as near black holes, General Relativity may modify Kepler\u2019s Third Law to account for relativistic effects. Conclusion Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a fundamental tool for understanding orbital mechanics, extending from planetary orbits to more complex celestial systems. Here\u2019s a simulation to verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits. Conclusion on general Kepler's Third Law helps calculate orbital periods based on the central mass and orbital radius. By comparing planets orbiting different central masses (like the Sun and hypothetical stars), we see that a larger central mass results in shorter orbital periods. This relationship is key to understanding planetary and exoplanetary systems. The log-log plot highlights how central mass and orbital radius influence orbital periods, with smaller masses leading to longer periods for a given radius. This law is a powerful tool for astronomers to estimate orbital periods in various celestial systems.
